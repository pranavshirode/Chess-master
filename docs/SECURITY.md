Security

Reporting vulnerabilities
- Open a private issue or email the maintainers with reproducible steps and impact.

Dependency management
- Regularly run dependency audits (npm audit or equivalent).
- Pin critical dependencies and update regularly.

Secrets
- Never commit secrets or private keys. Use environment variables or secret stores.

Data validation
- Sanitize inputs for PGN/FEN parsing and external data.
