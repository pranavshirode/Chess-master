Troubleshooting

Common issues
- Build fails: ensure correct runtime and clean node_modules; run npm ci.
- Tests failing intermittently: check for stateful tests; ensure tests are isolated.
- Incorrect move generation: reproduce with FEN and minimal test case, then open an issue with steps.

Getting help
- Open an issue with details: reproduction, logs, platform, steps to reproduce.
